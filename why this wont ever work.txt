Basically, it queues the lighting object from BYOND in that moment the moment its added to the SSlighting queue.

When an object is queued, its corner values are added in that moment, and if its already queued it wont be queded again in that update.
As you can imagine, this doesnt work if an object is impacted by multiple sources.

I have no idea what I am doing.
